    "For the AAPL ticker we can conclude that the optimization strategy resulted in a portfolio that was too conservative and failed to capture large market gains reflected in the passive strategy. It may have occurred that the market conditions for our trained data favored the RSI-Bollinger combination, but when tested on the test data it abysmally failed.\n",
    "\n",

    "Throughout the entire backtest of Bitcoin that was done, it is evident as shown by the flat blue line that no trades were performed by the optimized strategy. This means that there was no use in the combination of RSI, MACD and ADX, as well as the stop-loss and take-profit levels employed, which are rather tight as well, because there were no trades taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stop-loss of 4.2% and take-profit of 3.4% are relatively tight. These levels might have prevented trades from being executed, especially in a volatile asset like Bitcoin, where price movements are often larger.\n",
